# Thunderstruck (Name WIP)

## Goal
User(s) can give input in the form of taps (sound picked up by microphone).
The sound of the taps create notes on a notation interface, along with sound effects and graphics.

## Design
### Modules: QT shaders, 3D assets, and Multimedia. (Sound?)
### Languages: C++ and QLM.
Android Studio. QT Designer for UI and VFX.
The system loops through a 120 BPM 4/4 track onto which the notations are inserted. Multiple tracks can be overlaid for different sounds. The primary sounds are thunder and clap. A hi-hat track can be inserted on top.

## User Input Controls
Multimedia: Phone's microphone.
User input: Primarily sound input from taps.

## Graphics & VFX
Graphics can be described as sort of lightning effects, and also a system for waveform visualization.
But essentially the VFX include a sort of gradient for visualizing the waveform.

## GUI
### Buttons & Other Widgets
Buttons for Undo, Hit and Record.
### Upper Part
Interface upper part is Graphical effects. The upper part shows VFX generated by user input. Like gradient waveform / light effects the shape of which responds to input.
### Lower Part
Interface lower part is Data visualization of the notations, essentially.  The lower part represents sound "hits", meaning notes.

## SFX
Sound effects: thunder and clap.
